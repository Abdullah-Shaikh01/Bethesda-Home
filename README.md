# Bethesda Children Home Site 
In this project a simple website will be developed for Bethesda life center highlighting the need to help the orphans and showing the donors how their donation impacts the orphans lives.

Payment gateway is integrated to the website. There will be a simple donate button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc. Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the donor.
